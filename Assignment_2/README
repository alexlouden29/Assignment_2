This program is hard-coded to read only the PANID, MAC Addresses, and RSSI_M value per MAC Address from a file called "neighbor-dump.txt".
It could easily be edited to use a different file, parse a slightly different format, or pull out additional values.

To run the program, simply load in eclipse and click run.  The program can also be run from the command line with no arguments.
